		<p>	<small><strong>The team at Help The Homeless Coin is dedicated to supporting and focusing on those that need assistance by aiding charities with boots on the ground.
We will provide help with shelters, food, clothing, job seminars, access to local employers, and rehabilitation to help rebuild the lives of the homeless.
Every human on Earth has the right to a fair chance in life. But around the world, millions are being left behind – disadvantaged, endangered and deprived of everything they need to thrive. It doesn’t need to be this way. Investing in local and global communities where the poorest people live not only improves their lives but also the broader community. Let us break the vicious cycle of poverty.</strong></small>

			<p>
				<small><strong>Land for the Homeless is a New Jersey based 501(c)3 public charity, which is working to construct a supportive tiny home community on a plot of land it owns in Central NJ for the homeless to be able to live upon legally and in peace, without fear of unwarranted eviction or harassment. With shelter overcrowding continuing to be a serious issue across New Jersey and America as a whole, this project aims to create a low-cost solution to a very serious local problem with room for national expansion potential. The philosophy behind the project is that “anything is better than a park bench” and that the homeless problem will not be solved by simply trying to brush away those who are unsheltered but rather can be alleviated through the establishment of a well maintained and uplifting transitional environment for those affected to seek refuge and work toward bettering their situation.</strong></small>
